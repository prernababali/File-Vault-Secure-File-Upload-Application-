## Authentication Flow
1. User visits homepage and clicks **Login with Google**.
2. Passport.js handles the OAuth flow.
3. Upon success, user is redirected to the **dashboard**.
4. Session is created using `express-session`.



## File Upload Flow
1. User uploads a file via the dashboard form.
2. Multer saves the file to `public/uploads/`.
3. Prisma ORM stores the file name and user's email in the database.
4. Uploaded files are listed on the dashboard with public access links.



## Prisma Schema (Example)
prisma
model File {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  filename  String
  userEmail String
  uploaded  DateTime @default(now())
}

# Security Considerations

--> Sessions protect access to file uploads and dashboard.

--> File names are uniquely stored to avoid conflicts.

--> .env file hides all sensitive credentials.

--> Only authenticated users can access upload routes.


# Future Improvements

--> File deletion capability

--> User model and detailed tracking

--> Pagination for uploaded files

--> File size/type restrictions

--> UI improvements with Tailwind or Bootstrap
